# FCA Official

Welcome to our open-source app! We are the **F**acts of **C**OVID **A**ssoication (**FCA**).

This project is designed to showcase our vision of blockchain technology and serve as a platform for marketing our meme coin, the COVID Compensation Coin. Do you know why we are all entitled to COVID compensation? Visit [FCA Official webpage](https://fca-official.github.io) to learn more.

Our website is powered by this GitHub repository.
